While not overtly friendly towards low-boroq inlanders, Vantiro-1 are unlikely to initialize conflict; they are, however, particularly comfortable with self-defense, and very comfortable with verbal sparring when necessary. Far from being brittle, Vantiro-1 are blunt, generous, and feel most comfortable with a smaller and more familiar inner circle. They are also the most disciplined Vantiro subspecies, with a significant number of the population becoming masters of one or two crafts. Skills: Completion, commitment, listening, resilience.",
